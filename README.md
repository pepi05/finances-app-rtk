## Project description

The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to easily track their income and expenses. The application will be built using React and Redux Toolkit, which will provide a scalable and efficient solution for state management.

The application will have a user-friendly interface that allows LOGGED IN users to add, edit, and delete their income and expenses. Users will be able to categorize their transactions and view detailed reports.

The project will be divided into several components, including a user register/login, a transaction input form, a dashboard for visualizing income and expenses

Overall, the goal of this project is to provide users with a simple and effective tool for managing their finances. By leveraging the power of React and Redux Toolkit, we aim to create a fast, reliable, and user-friendly application that helps users take control of their financial lives.
